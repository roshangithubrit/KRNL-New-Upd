ðŸ“Š Customer Churn Prediction Project

I recently completed a customer churn prediction project using various machine learning algorithms. After rigorous testing, the models achieved the following accuracy scores:

Logistic Regression: 80.47% Support Vector Classifier (SVC): 86.27% Random Forest: 86.27% Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC): 86.30% XGBoost: 77.97% The project involved analyzing a dataset to predict customer churn, a critical metric for businesses. I explored the effectiveness of different algorithms and found that Support Vector Classifier, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Classifier performed exceptionally well. The detailed code, dataset, and a comprehensive analysis report are available in this GitHub repository. Feel free to explore, provide feedback, or use the code for your projects. Let's continue learning and improving together! ðŸš€ #MachineLearning #CustomerChurn #DataScience #GitHub #CodSoft @CodSoft
